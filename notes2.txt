<player types anything and ENTER to login>
let's start
type each word before time runs out
<player types the shown word, presses enter>
<word length is enforced, so player has to type at least n characters before enter will work>
<negative feedback if errors, positive otherwise>
continue doing this
every once in a while, replace typed text with a line from the poem as the user types
for poem lines, supply random garbage that's the same length as the line
as we get farther into the poem, decrease the time limit per word
by the "terror" line, the pace should be insane and totally unplayable
all of the words on the screen except the typed text should slowly fade to invisible by the time the terror line happens
and then wait
and then quickly return for the end of the game
show score of missed/correct words at the end
