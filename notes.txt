the walk to work was slow
shuffled my feet
breathed a lot

she left early that morning
when i was barely awake
i tried to say goodbye but probably all I got out was "mmmgff"

on the train i nervously tapped my phone
both jittery and run-down
uninterested in feeling anything else
and wanting to keep my mind off of the thoughts
that wouldn't stop no matter how I wished they would

thinking
literally anything could happen right now
and i wouldn't see it coming
and that would be it for me

i made myself a cup of tea at work
breathing heavily
and attempting to control the lump in my throat
and the feeling in my stomach
i thought it would calm me down
it did in an annoyingly superficial way

having the internet at my fingertips
and in front of my face for 8 hours
doesn't sound appealing
when everything I see makes my heart pound
and turns my throat into a screaming machine

the feeling doesn't go away all day
focusing on work doesn't happen
i type some things
talk to people in the office IRC
distracting myself from myself
or trying to anyway

every once in a while
i have a thought that sets me off
i'm typing a line
and the words aren't what i told them to be
it's the same word twice
or a smudge where i pressed all the wrong keys
like my hands are trying to pretend everything's fine

it doesn't feel real
to be in a full panic at my desk
wondering if anyone around me notices
while each part of my body tenses itself to its limit
holding back sobs that don't seem to have a purpose
a physical reaction
of terror

i get up hiding my face and walk quickly to the bathroom
close the door
lock it
open the window
look out at 31st street
and scream silently to the buildings
with only a faint idea of what I'm doing or why

it's easier after that
for a little while
i get some work done
order my computer around with magic spells
knowing that at any moment i'll become subhuman
hopefully i don't stick that way
